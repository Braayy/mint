  <h2>
    Syntax Error
  </h2>

  <p>
    The <b>list of functions and properties to expose</b> from a store and the
    <b>name of the store</b> must be separated with an <code>exposing</code>
    keyword.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was looking for that <code>from</code> keyword but found {{got}} instead.
